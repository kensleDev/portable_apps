All apps included are portable meaning that they don't need to be installed.

# Install

- Download or clone this folder to the C drive on your system
- Copy the app shortcuts to your desktop (or where ever you like)
- Run the app!

If the shortcuts dont work go into the apps folder(C:/portale_apps/Apps) -> right click -> create shortcut

# Run at bootup

## Apps
- All of the apps have an option in thier settings to start on bootup

## Scripts
- Windows-Extended-Keyboard is a script so the shortcut needs to be moved to: 

C:\Users\{YOUR_USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

- It also needs to be run as admistrator for all the functions to work. The shortcut included is already set to run as admin by default.
